                  <p>
                    We are now over 2 months after Evie's big surgery and we're incredibly thankful 
                    that she is adapting well to her new lifestyle. She has to be guided around when navigating
                    the house or outside at the front of the hosue, but she still seems to be enjoying life.
                    At the end of the day, that is all we wish for; for her to still be happy.
                    </p>
