This content is in relation to my dog, Evie. She has been a hugh part of mine and my mother's lives ever since
we got her in early 2016. While trying to think of content to add into this webpage, I could not get my mind off of Evie.
I added an extra photo into the pages to bring the total to 4, along with switching the orientation of the pictures and text on
the first page. Along with that, I changed some of the color choices in several areas of the CSS file.
