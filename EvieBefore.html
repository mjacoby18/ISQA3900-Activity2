      <p>
          Evie is a Yellow Labrador Retriever who will be 9 years old at the end of October. 
          She is a rescue from Hearts United for Animals in Auburn, Nebraska. While she has 
          been a playful and resilient girl her whole life, enjoying the outdoors to her fullest, 
          her medical issues have built up over time. As of earlier this year, she was diagnosed 
          with Diabetes and had to be put on insulin to balance her glucose levels. Unfortunately, 
          this was not enough to prevent her from developing Glaucoma in both of her eyes. At the 
          end of June this year, 2024, she needed to have both of her eyes removed due to the pressure 
          building up and medications not helping alleviate it anymore.
